XXX/TODO: Need some documentation here.

ledger.fs is like
[ledger.py](https://github.com/mafm/ledger.py/).
which was inspired by John Wiegley's
[Ledger](http://www.ledger-cli.org/)

If you want an overview, most of what I wrote about
[ledger.py](https://github.com/mafm/ledger.py/) applies here too -
this is just a rewrite because I need to make some additions and it's
a lot easier working in F# than python.
